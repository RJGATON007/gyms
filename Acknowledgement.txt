As the software developer of my capstone team, i would like to mention these names:

1. Kerwin Dave M. Granado - documentarian, technical writer
2. Meilgar B. Laureta - system analyst, tester
3. Roniel Dosujan - project manager

I would like to thank them for their hard work and dedication in making this project possible.
I would also like to thank my adviser, Mr. John Mathew Dino for guiding us throughout the development of this project.
We may be a small team, but we have a big heart in making this project possible.

Coding with limited resources is not easy,
but with the help of my team, we were able to make this project possible.

For the future developers who will be using this project,
i hope that you will find this project useful and helpful in your future endeavors.

Thank you and God bless.
